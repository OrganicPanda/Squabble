This is Squabble

This was just an experiment whilst I was reading the HTML5 Games book by Jacob Seidelin (http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2011/12/my-book-is-now-available.html). It is unlikely to ever be finished but is left here for my own personal reference. Most of the game is missing so please do not attempt to use it!
Todo:
